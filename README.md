# Procedural Map Generation
Inspired by the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm, this project delves into the generation of simple maps using rulesets.

The project includes renderers and visualizers.

To run it, you'll need Gradle and Groovy. Execute gradle run to generate a map. The generation process is beautifully animated.
