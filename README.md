# Procedural Map Generation
Inspired by the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm, this project investigates how to generate simple maps with rulesets.
The project comes with Renderers or Visualizers.

To run you need gradle and groovy. Run `gradle run` to generate a map. The Generation is nicely animated.
